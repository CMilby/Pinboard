# Pinboard

A simple windowed notetaking app

### About

---

Pinboard is a not taking app that allows you to draw new windows to take notes in. Click on the windows title to rename the window or click on the window body to type in the note. Click and drag your mouse anywhere else to create a new window. Drag from a window's lower right corner to resize your window or click and drag in the window title to move it around. Right click on a window to lock the size or position and then right click again to unlock it. All changes are saved to local storage so all your notes will be kept even when you close the window. Click on the palette icon to change Pinboard's theme or the undo button to undo the most recent changes you've made.
